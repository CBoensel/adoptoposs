# Contributing to Adoptoposs

Thanks for considering to contribute to Adoptoposs. ❤

Bug reports, feature suggestions, and pull requests for any open issues are very welcome. Issues can be reported on GitHub: https://github.com/adoptoposs/adoptoposs/issues/new.

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adoptoposs/adoptoposs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development setup

The app comes with a docker image for development. 
In order to setup the development environment you need to have some dependencies installed on your machine:

- make
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Checkout the Adoptoposs repository with

```
$ git clone git@github.com:adoptoposs/adoptoposs.git
```

Then step into the project and run the setup make task. This will build the docker container, create a development config, install all dependencies and setup development & test databases:

```
$ cd adoptoposs && make setup
```

Next, start the development server with:

```
$ make up
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.


For further detail on available make tasks please have a look into the task list:

```
$ make usage
```

## How to Contribute

For development we use the [git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) described by [nvie](https://github.com/nvie).

The `staging` branch always represents the current development state. 
So, this is the one you would branch off from when adding your changes.

The `main` branch represents the production state that is deployed to https://adotoposs.org.

Here’s how to contribute:

* Fork it (https://github.com/adoptoposs/adoptoposs/fork)
* Create your feature branch (git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature staging)
* Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
* Push to the branch (git push origin feature/my-new-feature)
* Create a new Pull Request

Try to add tests along with your new feature. This will ensure that your code does not break existing functionality and that your feature is working as expected. You can run the tests with:

```bash
make test
```

To watch file changes and rerun the test suite automatically, you can use:

```bash
make test-watch
```

If you’ve changed any Elixir code, please run Elixir’s code formatter before committing your changes:

```bash
make format
```

This will keep the code style consistent and future code diffs as small as possible.

As a contributor, please keep in mind this project is free and open source software. Maintainers are not paid to work on it, so there might be times were the maintainers seem unresponsive. If you have that feeling, please be patient and be assured, that all team members try their best to review your contribution and reply to you as soon as their time allows.
